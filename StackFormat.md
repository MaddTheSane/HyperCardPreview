# HyperCard File Format

This is a description of the format of HyperCard stacks.

The HyperCard file format has never been officially published, though originally intended by Bill Atkinson. The instructions in this file were retro-engineered by looking at various stacks and by comparing them, and sometimes by reading the assembly. Several people have contributed to that work: Rebecca Bettencourt, Tyler Vano, Uli Kusterer, myself. With special thanks to Michael Nichols and Bill Atkinson.

This description covers nearly all the data of a stack. But it is not complete enough to update stacks and create new ones.

## Prerequisites

All the integers are big-endian.

In flags, bits are counted from 0.

## File Layout

### Blocks

A HyperCard stack is a sequence of data blocks. Every block has:
* a type, represented as a four-character code, like `STAK`, `CARD`, `BKGD`.
* an ID that makes it unique among all the blocks of the same type in the stack.

### Block types

Here are the possible block types:
* [Stack Block](#stack-block): the global parameters of the stack (one in the file)
* [Master Block](#master-block): the index of the blocks in the file (one in the file)
* [List Block](#list-block): the list of the cards (one in the file)
* [Page Block](#page-block): a sub-section of the list of the cards
* [Card Block](#card-block): a card
* [Background Block](#background-block): a background
* [Bitmap Block](#bitmap-block): a picture of a card or of a background
* [Style Block](#style-block): the table of the text decorations used in the stack (at most one in the file)
* [Font Block](#font-block): the table of the font names used in the stack (at most one in the file)
* [Print Setting Block](#print-setting-block): the printing parameters (at most one in the file)
* [Page Set-Up Block](#page-set-up-block): the Page Setup settings (at most one in the file)
* [Report Template Block](#report-template-block): a report template
* [Free Block](#free-block): a free space inside the file
* [Tail Block](#tail-block): the ending block (one in the file)

### General Structure

The blocks in the stack are in the following order: 

| Blocks |
| --- |
| [Stack Block](#stack-block) |
| [Master Block](#master-block) |
| *Whatever blocks in any order* |
| [Tail Block](#tail-block) |

### Master Block

This block is an index of all the blocks present in the file (excluding [Stack Block](#stack-block), [Master Block](#master-block), [Free Blocks](#free-block), and [Tail Block](#tail-block)).

It consists of successive tables which are 0x200 bytes long. The first table starts at offset 0, it encloses the block header so contrary to the others, it doesn't have data on its first 0x20 bytes. The other tables follow at offsets 0x200, 0x400, and so on.

The tables consist of slots which are 4 bytes long. Every slot corresponds to a block in the file: the slot contains the position of the block, and on the other hand, the position of the slot can be computed with the ID of the block. So when a program has a block ID and is looking for the position of the block in the file, it just has to compute the position of the corresponding slot, find it and read the position inside. More information in [the procedure to find a block](#find-a-block-in-the-file).

The number of tables is written in the [Stack Block](#stack-block).

0x2 | UInt8 | State: `0x80` is "final", `0x60` is "beta", `0x40` is "alpha", `0x20` is "development"
0x3 | UInt8 | Release

For example, `0x02206044` is "version 2.2 beta release 44" (the release is written in hexa), and `0x02418000` is "version 2.4.1 final".

## Procedures

This section contains the procedures to decode some of the data.

### Open a Private Access stack

When a stack is Private Access, a part of the [Stack Block](#stack-block) is encrypted (from offset 0x18 to 0x4A). To decrypt it, you must ask the user for a password (if you want to hack the encryption, see [the procedure about it](#hack-a-private-access-stack)).

First, here are two utility functions: 

```
% This is the 'Random' function of the first Mac OS (not very random)
function hashNumber(x: UInt32):
    h := x * 0x41A7
    h := h + (h >> 31)
    h := h & 0x7FFFFFFF
    return h

% This is the password hash function used by HyperCard
function hash(string: String):
    h: UInt32 := 0

    x: UInt32 := string[0] + string.length
    if x > 0xFF:
        x := x & 0xFF
    else if string[0] > 0x80:
        x := x | 0xFFFFFF00

    foreach character in string:
        foreach bit in character: // from higher to lower bit
            x := hashNumber(x)
            if bit:
                h := h + x

    if h = 0:
        return 0x42696C6C   %'Bill'

    return h
```

To decrypt the [Stack Block](#stack-block), here is the procedure:

```
function decryptStackBlock(password: String):
    h: UInt32 := hash(password)
    repeat 10 times
        h := hashNumber(h)
    for i in {0x18, 0x1A, ..., 0x46}
        h := hashNumber(h)
        (stackBlock[i] as UInt32) := h XOR (stackBlock[i] as UInt32)
```

After this procedure, the password hash is decrypted. It must then be checked against the password given by the user (see [the procedure to do it](#check-a-password)), and only then it can be certified as valid.

### Check a password

If a stack has a password hash different from zero, the password must (theoretically) be asked to the user. A stack can have a password without being Private Access, that is, without being encrypted.

The password given by the user is hashed, and if the result hash not equal to the hash in the stack, the stack can't be opened.

To hash a password, here is the procedure:

```
function hashPassword(password: String):
	h1: UInt32 := hash(password)
	s: String := h1 as 4-character String
	h2: UInt32 := hash(s)
	return h2
```

### Hack a Private Access stack

It is possible to decrypt an encrypted [Stack Block](#stack-block) without the password. We describe roughly how to do it.

The first encrypted 32-bit integer of the [Stack Block](#stack-block), at offset 0x18, is a big weakness because it contains the offset of the [Master Block](#master-block), which is always equal to the size of the [Stack Block](#stack-block), and we know that one because it is written in the header. So by XORing the size of the [Stack Block](#stack-block) with that integer, we get `h`, the value used to XOR the integer.

According to the function `decryptStackBlock`, the value `h` is equal to `x XOR (hashNumber(x) >> 16)`, `x` being an unknown 32-bit integer. But, as we see, the first 16 bits of `h` are the same first 16 bits of `x`, so we already know half of `x`. For the remaining 16 bits, we just have to check them all: for every possible value of `x`, we compute `x XOR (hashNumber(x) >> 16)` and check if it is equal to `h`.

There may be more than one `x` that works (there can be two), so when a value is found, the checksum of the [Stack Block](#stack-block) must be checked to see if the decrypted data is the right one.

### Check the checksum of the Stack Block

To check it: cast as `UInt32[384]` the whole [Stack Block](#stack-block) (up to offset 0x600, until the script). The sum of the ints must be zero.

If the stack is Private Access, the checksum must be computed on the decrypted data.

### Find a block in the file

This procedure is to find the position of a block in the file from its ID.

To do that, the slot of the block must be found in the [Master Block](#master-block). The position of that slot is computed with the ID of the block.

In fact, the ID of a block has three parts:
- bits 0-7: a random value, to identify the block a little bit,
- bits 8-14: when multiplied by 4, the offset of the slot in the table,
- bits 15-31: the index of the table where the slot lies.

So the position of the slot is just extracted from the ID.

As for the slot, it is also divided, it has two parts: 
- bits 0-7: the random value of the corresponding ID, so it can be checked,
- bits 8-31: when multiplied by 0x20, the offset of the block in the file.

So the lowest byte of the slot we've found must be equal to the lowest byte of the ID.

Then the position of the block is just extracted from the slot.

### Check the checksum of the list

```
function computeListChecksum():
	x: UInt32 := 0
	for pageReference in pageReferences:
		x := x + pageReference.identifier
		x := rotateRight3Bits(x)
		x := x + pageReference.numberOfCards
	return x
```

### Check the checksum of a page

```
function computePageChecksum():
	x: UInt32 := 0
	for cardReference in cardReferences:
		x := x + cardReference.identifier
		x := rotateRight3Bits(x)
	return x
```

### Check a word in a word search hash

The word search hash has been largely retro-engineered but it is complex and there are details I'm not sure about. If you're interested, see the source code of HyperCardPreview.

### Decompress a bitmap image

Bitmaps are compressed in a proprietary format designed by Bill Atkinson. This part is dedicated to Rebecca Bettencourt, who retro-engineered this format and christened it "WOBA", Wrath of Bill Atkinson, for its tortuous complexity.

A bitmap has two layers: an image and a mask. Both are decompressed to a raw data with 1 bit per pixel, aligned to 32 bits. The color of a pixel is given by:
- if the pixel has a value of 1 in the image, it is black.
- elsewhere, if it has a value of 1 in the mask, it is blank.
- elsewhere, it is transparent.

Both the mask and the image have a bounding rectangle (which can be zero) and a content data (which can be present or not). Here is how they interact:
- if the content data is present, it is decompressed and displayed in the bounding rectangle.
- if the content data is not present but the bounding rectangle is not zero, the pixels in the bounding rectangle are 1.
- if the content data is not present and the bounding rectangle is zero, the pixels everywhere are 0.

Before decompressing the data, the bounding rectangles of the mask and of the image must be rounded down to a multiple of 32 bits to the left side, and rounded up to a multiple of 32-bits to the right side. The result rectangles enclose white pixels on each side.

The compressed data is a series of instructions of various lengths. The first byte of an instruction, the opcode, indicates how long the instruction is and what it does. The remaining bytes, if any, are data needed for the instruction. Rows can be compressed with a single instruction (with opcodes in the range 0x80-0x87) or a sequence of multiple instructions (with opcodes in the ranges of 0x00-0x7F and 0xC0-0xFF). Some operations change the manner in which rows are decompressed (opcodes in the range 0x88-0xBF). The end of a row comes either when the row has been filled (when the number of bytes in a row, determined by the mask or image's bounding rectangle, has been reached) or when an opcode in the range 0x80-0xBF is encountered.

The instructions are listed below:

Opcode | Instruction | Description
--- | --- | ---
0x00-0x7F | `dz xx xx xx ...` | `z` zero bytes followed by `d` data bytes
0x80 | `80 xx xx xx ...` | one row of decompressed data
0x81 | `81` | one white row
0x82 | `82` | one black row
0x83 | `83 xx` | one row of a repeated byte of data
0x84 | `84` | one row of a repeated byte of data previously used (see below)
0x85 | `85` | copy the previous row
0x86 | `86` | copy the row before the previous row
0x87 | `87` | *not used*
0x88 | `88` | `dh` = 16, `dv` = 0 (see below)
0x89 | `89` | `dh` = 0, `dv` = 0 (see below)
0x8A | `8A` | `dh` = 0, `dv` = 1 (see below)
0x8B | `8B` | `dh` = 0, `dv` = 2 (see below)
0x8C | `8C` | `dh` = 1, `dv` = 0 (see below)
0x8D | `8D` | `dh` = 1, `dv` = 1 (see below)
0x8E | `8E` | `dh` = 2, `dv` = 2 (see below)
0x8F | `8F` | `dh` = 8, `dv` = 0 (see below)
0x90-0x9F | | *not used*
0xA0-0xBF | `101nnnnn` | repeat the next instruction `n` times
0xC0-0xDF | `110ddddd xx ...` | `d`*8 bytes of data
0xE0-0xFF | `111zzzzz` | `z`*16 bytes of zero

About repeated bytes of data: keep an array of 8 bytes, initialize it at `0xAA55AA55AA55AA55` (gray pattern). When a 0x83 instruction is encountered, take the current y-coordinate modulo 8, and put the byte into that element of the array. When a 0x84 instruction is encountered, take the row y-coordinate modulo 8, and use that element of the array to fill the row.

About `dh` and `dv`: these values are used apply transformations to a row, initially `dh` = 0 and `dv` = 0. Every time a row is completed (except single-instruction rows in the range 0x80-0x87), the following operations are performed:
- Make a copy of the row.
- If `dh` != 0, repeat:
	- Shift the copied row `dh` bits to the right.
	- If the copied row is zero, stop looping
	- XOR the copied row with the original row.
- If `dv` != 0, XOR the copied row with the row `dv` rows back.
- Set the original row to the copied row

## Stacks of HyperCard 1.xx

In HyperCard 1.xx, the stacks have a slightly different format. We list all the differences.

### General Differences

There are no decorated texts in the stacks, so there are neither [Style Block](#style-block) nor [Font Block](#font-block).

Some values are absent, but as they are set to zero, they can be parsed like v2.xx values and then be considered as empty or default.

The block headers are shorter because they don't have the empty alignment integers at 0xC. So, some fields aren't at the same place because at v2.xx they had to move values to let room for the new wider headers, and sometimes it caused a little mess.

### Stack Block

The checksum is at offset 0xC

Note: the card size, window rectangle, screen rectangle, scroll origin, style block, font block, don't exist and are set to zero. But they can be parsed *as is* in v2.xx.

### List Block

All values at offsets between 0x10 and 0x28 are moved 4 bytes to the left. The page references remain at offset 0x30.

### Page Block

Both values at offsets 0x10 and 0x14 are moved 4 bytes to the left. The card references remain at offset 0x18.

### Card Block

Except the header, all the values are shifted 4 bytes to the left.

### Background Block

Except the header, all the values are shifted 4 bytes to the left.

### Part Content

Part contents are always plain strings. They are not aligned to 16-bits, they can be off by 1 byte.

Offset | Type | Content
--- | --- | ---
0x0 | SInt16 | ID of the part that has the content. If the value is < 0, it is a card part with ID (-partID). Otherwise it is a background part.
0x2 | [String](#string) | String content

### Bitmap Block

Except the header, all the values are shifted 4 bytes to the left.
